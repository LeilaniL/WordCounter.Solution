# Word Counter
#### by Leilani Leach

## Description
This program asks users for a sentence, and a word they want to find in that sentence. It counts the occurences of that word and returns the number of times it appears in the sentence. This is the first C# independent project for Epicodus.

## Setup Instructions

## Specs
* User inputs both a sentence, and a word that they want to count in the sentence.
_Example: Input "the" and "The cat walks down the street."_

* Program finds whether that word is in the sentence. It returns full and exact matches only (disregarding case).
_Example: Input "the" and "The cat walks down the street with them."_
_Expected output: true_

* Program counts how many times that word appears in the sentence. It returns full and exact matches only (disregarding case).
_Example: Input "the" and "The cat walks down the street with them."_
_Expected output: 2_

* If there are no full, exact matches, the program returns "No Matches Found."
_Example: Input "dog" and "The cat walks down the street with them."_
_Expected output: "No Matches Found"_
